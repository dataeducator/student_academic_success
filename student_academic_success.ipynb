    "Carnevale et. al. (2021) Georgetown University in their study highlighted the substantial disparity in lifetime earnings based on educational attainment. In particular, the gist of this study showed that an average person with only a high school diploma or GED will earn an estimated  __1.6  million dollars__ in their lifetime, compared to a person with a bachelor's degree who potentially can earn ~__2.8 million dollars__ in their lifetime. This profound disparity in earning potential underscores the transformative power of higher education and highlights the significance of timely graduation in enhancing students' long-term financial security."
